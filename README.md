# Spam Classification with Multinomial Naive Bayes (Enron Spam Dataset)

This project implements a **spam email classifier** using **Multinomial Naive Bayes** with **Bag-of-Words (1-2 grams)** text representation. It includes data preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation using traditional NLP techniques.
